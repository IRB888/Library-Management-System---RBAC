I built CircuLib to handle library catalog and borrowing workflows across three roles: admin, librarian, and student. It has a React frontend, an Express API, and a PostgreSQL database. The borrowing rules, loans, fees, and reports use database records and SQL routines.

[Open the demo](https://library-management-system-rbac.vercel.app/)

## What it does

- **Admin:** manage books, physical copies, librarian accounts, and membership types; view library totals and reports.
- **Librarian:** look up students and barcodes, issue and return books, review overdue loans and alerts, and handle reservations.
- **Student:** register, browse books, see personal loans, fees, payment history, and alerts; save books to a wishlist, leave reviews, and request reservations.
- **Shared:** JWT login, role-based routes, profile and password updates, announcements, and light/dark themes.

Membership types set borrowing limits, loan periods, and daily late fees. Checkout and return logic lives in both API transactions and SQL routines. The reports cover inventory, circulation, overdue loans, member activity, and outstanding balances.

Fee payments are database accounting records, not an online payment gateway. Overdue alert generation is a librarian action. Reservations have a basic request, fulfillment, and cancellation flow; automated queue handling is a next step.

## Stack

- React 18, Vite, Material UI, React Router, Zustand, Axios, and Recharts
- Node.js, Express, JWT, Helmet, CORS, and `pg`
- PostgreSQL tables, constraints, functions, procedures, and views; `pgcrypto` for password hashes

## Run it locally

Use Node.js 20+ and PostgreSQL with permission to create extensions. The current database client uses TLS, so use a TLS-enabled PostgreSQL connection. For a local server without TLS, adjust [the pool configuration](backend/src/config/db.js) before starting the API.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/miteshanshu/Library-Management-System---RBAC.git
cd Library-Management-System---RBAC
cd backend
npm ci
cp .env.example .env
```

Set these values in `backend/.env`:

```dotenv
PORT=5000
NODE_ENV=development
DATABASE_URL=your_postgresql_connection_string
DB_SCHEMA=library_app
JWT_SECRET=your_own_long_random_secret
JWT_EXPIRY=24h
```

### Database setup

Start with a fresh database. The base tables and indexes are bootstrap scripts, not a migration system, so don't rerun the full sequence against an existing database.

Apply the files in this order with `psql` or your database SQL editor:

1. [Core tables](db/schema/00_init_schema.sql)
2. [Constraints and indexes](db/schema/01_constraints_indexes.sql)
3. Enable `pgcrypto` in `library_app`: `CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS pgcrypto WITH SCHEMA library_app;`. If it already exists in another schema, make sure that schema is in the search path when running the auth script.
4. [Users and authentication](db/schema/02_users_and_auth.sql)
5. [Reviews, wishlist, reservations, and announcements](db/schema/03_modern_features.sql)
6. [Checkout and returns](db/procedures/checkout_and_return.sql)
7. [Overdue alerts and fees](db/procedures/overdue_and_fees.sql)
8. [Analytics views](db/views/analytics_views.sql) and [overdue loans view](db/views/vw_overdue_loans.sql)
9. [Admin views](db/admin/admin_views.sql) and [admin functions](db/admin/admin_functions.sql)
10. [Inventory and member reports](db/reports/inventory_and_member_reports.sql)
11. For fuzzy search, apply [search indexes](db/schema/07_fuzzy_search_indexes.sql). This script enables `pg_trgm` and uses the application and public search paths.
12. Optionally load [sample library data](db/seeds/sample_data.sql).

Use the credential-verification function in the auth schema script above. The standalone `db/functions/fn_verify_user_credentials.sql` is now a pointer to that canonical definition, not a second function to install.

The auth bootstrap includes demo and admin accounts. Replace the seeded passwords before exposing your own deployment. Demo restrictions currently cover profile and password changes, so use an isolated database for a public demo.

### Start the API and frontend

In the backend directory:

```bash
npm run dev
```

In a second terminal, from the repository root:

```bash
cd frontend
npm ci
```

Create `frontend/.env.local`:

```dotenv
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:5000/api
```

Then run:

```bash
npm run dev
```

The API runs on `http://localhost:5000` and Vite on `http://localhost:5173`. Set `VITE_API_URL` explicitly for local development; otherwise the client uses the hosted Render API.

## API and SQL

The API groups are `/api/auth`, `/api/admin`, `/api/librarian`, `/api/student`, `/api/circulation`, `/api/reports`, `/api/search`, and `/api/features`. [Route files](backend/src/routes) show the endpoints and role checks; [controllers](backend/src/controllers) show how they use the database.

`GET /api/health` checks that the API process responds. It is not a database readiness check.

## Checks

```bash
cd frontend
npm run build
node --test tests/retry.test.js
```

The retry tests cover transient errors, retry limits, authentication errors, cancellation, and avoiding automatic retries on other writes. The backend lists Jest and Playwright scripts and includes Playwright configuration; database-backed integration coverage is a next step.

## Contributing

I welcome focused fixes to the library workflows and setup. There is useful work in the React UI, Express controllers and PostgreSQL routines. You do not need to understand the whole app to take a small issue.

### Pick a change

- Check the open issues and existing pull requests before starting. If you want to take an issue, leave a short comment with your approach and wait for a reply so we do not duplicate work.
- Start with issues labelled `good first issue` for a small, isolated change. `difficulty: medium` issues need more familiarity with the workflow and tests.
- Keep one issue per PR. A bug fix should not include unrelated formatting, redesigns or dependency updates.
- If you find a new bug, include your role, expected result, actual result, reproduction steps and relevant error output. Remove tokens, connection strings and personal data from logs.

### Make and check the change

Fork the repository, create a branch and follow the local setup above. Use a separate database with test data. The shared demo is not a test environment for writes, loans, fees or account changes.

For a fix, show how you reproduced the problem and how you checked the result. Add a focused regression test where practical. For UI changes, include actual before/after screenshots and check a narrow mobile screen as well as desktop. For SQL changes, include an isolated database test and explain any migration or rollback needs.

The frontend build and retry tests above are available checks. The backend exposes `npm run lint`, `npm test` and `npm run test:e2e`, but the current tree does not contain a complete backend test suite. Run checks relevant to your change and report the real result; do not mark a check passed if it was unavailable or stopped on an existing failure. New focused tests are welcome.

In the PR description, include:

1. The issue and behavior being changed.
2. The smallest change that fixes it.
3. The commands, screenshots or database cases used to verify it.
4. Any remaining limitation or check you could not run.

If you can no longer work on a claimed issue, leave a short update so someone else can take it. Do not post exploit details or credentials in a public issue. For a security concern, ask for a private reporting route without including sensitive details.

## Next steps

My next priorities are tighter public-demo write restrictions, repeatable database migrations, tests for circulation and role boundaries, automated reservation expiry and queue handling, and consistent search and loan-close behavior.
